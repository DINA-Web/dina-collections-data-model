## Data dictionary for schema development

This folder contains a manually created data dictionary that
describes the data elements (tables and columns) that are used/has
been used/will be used in the DINA collections data model. This data
dictionary is primarily intended to guide the development of the
database schema.

Data elements are approved for use in the model when they have a
specific version set (version_added) and they are then active until a
removed_version is set. When a version is set for a data element, all
mandatory information (according to the specification) should be set
for the element. If there is info that applies, "NA" should be used.
